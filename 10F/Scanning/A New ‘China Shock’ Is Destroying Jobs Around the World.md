From Indonesia to Mexico, job losses could mount as Trump’s tariffs divert even more Chinese exports from the US.

Near the Indonesian city of Surakarta, a one-time royal capital on the island of Java that’s long been known for producing elaborate fabrics, dozens of once-bustling garment factories sit empty behind locked gates.

At a coffee shop not far from the plant where he was employed for more than three decades, 53-year-old Hariyanto blamed cheap imports from China for the economic devastation. One of about 1,500 employees furloughed at an apparel maker last year, the former low-level manager is now leading a legal fight to get back pay and severance from the company, which is financially stressed and looking to sell off assets.

“I’m worried China could pressure the government to accept the current conditions,” Hariyanto, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, said on a scorching day in February. “If a company goes down, it’s more than just those they employ who feel it,” he added. “It impacts every part of the community.”

Southeast Asia’s biggest economy [lost](https://apsyfi.org/news/115 "Link") roughly a quarter-million jobs in the textiles and apparel industry over the last two years, according to the Indonesia Fiber and Filament Yarn Producer Association, which has [estimated](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/indonesia-garment-sector-faces-massive-layoffs-on-china-dumping "Indonesia Garment Sector Faces Massive Layoffs on China Dumping") another half-million are at risk in 2025—effectively wiping out one of four jobs in the sector in a matter of years. That pace is considerably faster than the “China Shock” that claimed as many as 2.4 million US jobs from 1999 to 2011.

“This is China Shock 2.0 or China Shock 3.0,” says Gordon Hanson, a professor of urban policy at the Harvard Kennedy School and one of the authors of the [research paper](https://www.nber.org/papers/w21906) that coined the name of the phenomenon. “China has this immense manufacturing capacity, and the goods have to go somewhere.” The lesson from the US experience, he added, is that “there’s a political response to all this. People get mad.”

The hollowing out of local economies in the American heartland helped lead to the rise of Donald Trumpas a political force. Seeking to rebalance US-China trade and bring manufacturing jobs home, Trump imposed tariffs on China during his first term that were kept in place by the Biden administration. Chinese manufacturers priced out of the US had to search for alternative markets, while some moved production to other countries to evade duties.

Boosting exports became even more urgent when President Xi Jinping took steps around 2020 to deflate a property bubble. He then ramped up investment in manufacturing to bolster the economy, propelling China’s trade surplus to an all-time high of just under $1 trillion in 2024. While Xi’s government has signaled its intention to shift the economy more toward consumption, robust exports will still be needed this year to hit an ambitious growth target of about 5%.

The pain in Indonesia is being felt in other emerging economies, and it’s only set to get worse: Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on China even higher, after hiking them by 20% since taking office in January. This means the country’s exporters, by far the most competitive in the world, are looking to replace any lost orders—a dynamic that risks unleashing an even larger flood of Chinese goods around the globe.

And it’s not just big-ticket items such as electric vehicles, solar panels and steel that have become a source of friction between China and other nations. It’s garments and other lower-end goods—manufacturing components in Southeast Asia, internet cables in Brazil, electronics in India—that developing countries would typically sell to richer nations. There’s also the millions of small packages sent every day directly to consumers from Chinese e-tailers, undermining local products.

If that wasn’t enough for developing economies, Trump is threatening to impose “reciprocal” tariffs on all nations, starting on April 2. Leaders of countries caught in the middle of US-China tensions—most of whom are reluctant to pick a side—must delicately navigate relations with each of the two giants while preventing job losses at home that could ultimately cost them power.

Research by Bloomberg Economics shows that China has roughly managed to maintain its share of global exports despite a big drop in its share of total US imports since Trump’s first term. Since 2017, many emerging economies have seen their purchases from China increase substantially, taking its manufactured goods trade surplus to [historic heights](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/S4G1VLDWLU68).

While a good portion of that is finished products like Chinese-made cellphones, clothing and home appliances, there has also been a jump in imports of parts and materials destined for factories producing goods for export to the US—evidence that Trump’s tariffs triggered a shift in global supply chains.

Although higher American tariffs on China have helped other nations sell more to the US, Trump’s new threat of duties on all countries “raises the risks that some of these opportunities in the US market will disappear,” says Maeva Cousin, chief trade economist at Bloomberg Economics. “Asian economies are walking a tightrope in the US-China trade wars,” she says. “Competition from goods imported from China is clearly a challenge for many of their companies, and the diversion of Chinese exports away from the US is intensifying that trend.”

Pressure is mounting for governments to take action. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum this month said her country would review tariffs on Chinese shipments, linking growing violence in places such as central Guanajuato state to large-scale job losses in its shoe and textile industries.

“So much of the entry of Chinese products into Mexico caused this industry to fall in our country,” Sheinbaum [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-07/mexico-to-review-china-tariffs-in-potential-win-for-trump "Mexico to Review China Tariffs in Potential Win for Trump") on March 6. Mexico has already raised tariffs on textile and apparel imports from China to as much as 35%, and it’s under pressure from the Trump administration to raise levies on Chinese shipments more broadly.

Sanan Angubolkul, the head of Thailand’s Chamber of Commerce, warned this month that the situation is “very critical, and there’s no time to waste” as the nation deals with a surge of electrical appliances, clothing and other Chinese goods. The country last year extended a 7% value-added tax on imported goods below $50 to mitigate the impact of Chinese e-tailer Temu, owned by PDD Holdings Inc.

Malaysia added a 10% sales tax on online purchases of low-value goods last year, while Indian authorities have taken a range of measures, including anti-dumping probes on items as diverse as Chinese solar cells, aluminum foil and mobile phone components. Vietnam’s government, meanwhile, ordered Temu and Shein Group Ltd. to suspend operations in the country last year, citing incomplete business and tax registration paperwork.

Still, it’s not easy for governments to block imports from China, which for many is their largest trading partner as well as a source of cheap financing for power plants, high-speed rail and other infrastructure projects. “Do you really want to complain over shoes when someone’s building you a port?” asks Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation, an Asia-based research group.

While Chinese exporters sometimes engage in smuggling or dumping, the advantage they enjoy over competitors elsewhere really comes down to the scale, efficiency and speed honed by operating in a “cutthroat domestic market,” Elms says. “If you can survive in China, you must be doing something right. And when you turn that focus outward, you are also supercompetitive in almost all global markets.”

China is sensitive to accusations that its giant export machine is hurting developing countries. Earlier this month, at an annual press briefing with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi where questions are vetted in advance, a journalist from a Pakistani news outlet asked about the deluge of Chinese goods in neighboring countries. China’s top diplomat responded by saying it’s “common for neighbors to not agree on everything” while noting that his nation remains the “engine of economic development.”

“China will continue to open wider to neighboring countries, including through unilateral initiatives, and share more development benefits with its neighbors,” Wang said. The journalist’s question on Chinese goods was scrubbed from the [official transcript](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjbzhd/202503/t20250307_11571025.html "Link") of the event posted on the Foreign Ministry’s website.

China has been adept at containing the geopolitical fallout, ramping up diplomacy and portraying itself as a stable alternative to Trump. Xi’s government is also keeping tariffs [low](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202411/1324070.shtml#:~:text=China%20will%20give%20all%20the,to%20announce%20such%20a%20policy. "Link") for poorer countries as Trump moves to raise them.

Even as calls grow in Thailand for more action on Chinese imports, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra visited Beijing last month in the hopes of attracting more Chinese tourists as well as investments in multibillion-dollar projects. In an interview with state-run *China Daily*, Paetongtarn touted her “Chinese blood,” a nod to family roots that extend back to southern Guangdong province, and hailed the “awesome relationship” between the countries.

The concerns about China’s dominance of global clothing and textile production have been building for at least five years, according to Simon Evenett, founder of the St. Gallen Endowment for Prosperity Through Trade, a group based in Switzerland that tracks trade policies. Countries in Southeast Asia have generally refrained fromerecting trade barriers and instead quietly subsidized local producers who’ve run into trouble.

“They’re not poking the Chinese panda in the eye,” Evenett says. “If you’re a small guy right next to a big guy—David and Goliath—sometimes it makes sense to advance your interests in a way that doesn’t get attention. And that’s what they’ve done.”

The US has long complained about Chinese overcapacity in industrial sectors, an issue that former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen repeatedly [brought up](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-23/yellen-calls-for-united-front-on-chinese-industrial-overcapacity "Yellen Calls for United Front on Chinese Industrial Overcapacity") in meetings with her counterparts in Beijing. Yet some officials in Southeast Asia don’t see that as the main problem.

“Most people talk about overcapacity—it’s not so much of overcapacity per se, versus the shrinking of demand in China,” Liew Chin Tong, Malaysia’s deputy trade minister, says in an interview. Rather than rushing to put tariffs on China, he says, Malaysia aims to attract more Chinese investment and build up regional wealth so Asia isn’t so dependent on the US consumer.

“We’re navigating a potentially difficult US market because of the change of government and already very weak Chinese demand,” Liew says. “Each move we are trying to execute is trying to balance this.”

In Indonesia, officials are similarly reluctant to criticize China despite the mounting job losses in the garment sector. China accounts for more than a quarter of the nation’s overall trade—about three times as much as any other country. Xi’s government has also helped Indonesia build high-speed rails and is investing large sums in the country to process minerals, helping with the government’s strategy to move up the value chain.

President Prabowo Subianto, who continues to enjoy high approval ratings since assuming office in October, has threatened to sink ships that smuggle in textiles. He’s also sought to rescue Indonesian textile giant PT Sri Rejeki Isman, known as Sritex, which is mired in bankruptcy proceedings.The company,which has sewn clothes for global brands including [H&M](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/HMB:SS), Uniqlo and Zara, employed roughly 50,000 workers ahead of planned layoffs earlier this year.

So far, Prabowo has resisted calls for stronger measures, such as a proposal [floated](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-02/indonesia-is-preparing-ways-to-safeguard-local-textile-industry "Indonesia Seeks to Guard Textile Industry From Chinese Goods (1)") by government ministers last year to impose 200% tariffs on a range of Chinese products. Indonesian Deputy Trade Minister Dyah Roro Esti Widya Putri said in an interview last month that the government is taking a “wait-and-see” approach on the impact of Chinese imports. Others believe Prabowowill ultimately take more decisive action. “He’s a populist president, so he’ll be more protectionist,” says Yessi Vadila, a trade analyst in Indonesia’s Ministry of Trade.

On the island of Java, Surakarta’s shuttered factories aren’t the only evidence of the damage caused by the onslaught of cheap Chinese imports. Laweyan, a village dating back to the 15th century that’s known for its traditional handmade batik—a method that employs wax and dye to produce an intricately patterned type of cloth—is also under threat.

The area, once one of Indonesia’s wealthiest enclaves, has long drawn visitors from around the world. Yet during an offseason visit in February, its narrow alleys were practically empty. Shop owners were seldom found, with employees sitting around and scrolling on their phones.

Alpha Febela Priyatmono, the 65-year-old head of a local batik association, said factories in China can now make the fabric much cheaper. He sells about 10 shirts a day, down from 90 previously. “Chinese importers are our biggest challenge,” he said. “There’s a risk of the village disappearing altogether.”
