# Domain impact brief: AI datacenter energy demands and global decarbonization tensions

## Summary
According to an International Energy Agency (IEA) report, AI-driven datacenters are projected to more than quadruple their energy consumption by 2030, demanding nearly as much electricity as the entire nation of Japan consumes today. While this explosive growth poses significant challenges to energy systems and environmental goals, the report suggests the climate threat may be "overstated" as AI applications could potentially create offsetting efficiencies. This development is creating complex trade-offs between competing priorities: technological advancement, energy consumption, and climate mitigation efforts.

## Domains impacted

### Energy Systems
- **WHAT**: Global electricity demand from datacenters will more than double by 2030, with AI datacenters alone quadrupling their consumption. In the US, data processing is expected to consume more electricity than all other energy-intensive goods (steel, cement, chemicals) combined by 2030.
- **WHY**: The computational demands of AI systems are exponentially growing as the technology becomes embedded in business, government, and consumer applications. Modern datacenters consume electricity equivalent to 100,000 households, with newer facilities requiring 20 times more.
- **SO WHAT**: This surge is likely to reverse gains made in reducing energy consumption in advanced economies, potentially reviving fossil fuel infrastructure (including gas plants and even coal-fired power stations) despite their planned phase-out in many developed nations. Only about half of the new energy demand is expected to be met through renewable sources.

### Climate Mitigation & Adaptation
- **WHAT**: The IEA report suggests that AI's energy consumption impact on climate goals has been "overstated" as the technology could potentially generate offsetting efficiency gains in energy systems, industrial processes, and transportation networks.
- **WHY**: AI applications could optimize electricity grids for renewable energy integration, increase industrial efficiencies, improve public transportation planning, and aid in critical mineral discovery necessary for renewable energy components.
- **SO WHAT**: These competing narratives about AI's net climate impact will significantly influence climate policy approaches, potentially creating a fragmented regulatory landscape where some jurisdictions prioritize AI development while others impose strict energy consumption limits on the technology, further complicating international climate agreements.

### Technology Governance
- **WHAT**: Despite the IEA's optimistic assessment of potential efficiencies, they note that realizing positive outcomes will require greater governmental direction and regulation of AI development.
- **WHY**: Left unregulated, market-driven AI expansion could create severe problems for energy systems and environmental goals, including excessive water consumption in water-stressed regions for cooling infrastructure.
- **SO WHAT**: This tension between technology advancement and resource limitations is driving divergent governance approaches, with some regions developing stringent reporting requirements for tech firms' energy and water use, while others (potentially including the US under the Trump administration) may prioritize technological development with minimal restrictions, further fragmenting the global technology governance landscape.

## Key questions for workshop

1. How might competition for energy resources to power AI infrastructure reshape geopolitical alliances, particularly between energy-rich nations and technology leaders?

2. What new governance models might emerge at the intersection of technology regulation and environmental policy as the AI energy crisis intensifies?

3. Could the divergence in approaches to AI energy consumption create a new kind of "carbon leakage" where AI operations migrate to regions with less restrictive environmental regulations?
