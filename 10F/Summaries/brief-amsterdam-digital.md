# Domain impact brief: Amsterdam's digital independence initiative

## Summary
The City of Amsterdam has launched an initiative to reduce its dependence on foreign (particularly American) technology companies, citing concerns about data sovereignty, service continuity, and national security. The municipal government has conducted an exploratory study to identify realistic steps toward greater digital autonomy and is implementing concrete measures to maintain control over its technological infrastructure. This effort aligns with broader European aims to establish digital sovereignty in the face of increasing geopolitical tensions.

## Domains impacted

### Tech governance
- **WHAT**: Amsterdam is implementing "digital autonomy" as a new criterion for technology procurement, starting with upcoming public cloud and hosting contracts.
- **WHY**: The municipal government sees excessive dependence on American tech giants as a serious risk to privacy, service continuity, and security.
- **SO WHAT**: This represents a significant shift in how public institutions evaluate technology providers, prioritizing sovereignty over convenience or cost, potentially setting a precedent for other European municipalities.

### Information ecosystems
- **WHAT**: The city is exploring alternatives to commercial social media platforms and testing open-source software for email, word processing, and spreadsheets.
- **WHY**: Amsterdam aims to maintain control over its critical digital infrastructure and reduce reliance on proprietary systems that limit data control and migration.
- **SO WHAT**: This could accelerate development of open-source alternatives to dominant commercial platforms and create more diverse information ecosystems less vulnerable to foreign influence.

### Civil society
- **WHAT**: Amsterdam is working with community partners to develop social media strategies that reduce platform dependency while ensuring they can still reach all city residents.
- **WHY**: The municipal government recognizes both the importance of digital communication with citizens and the risks of relying on platforms controlled by foreign corporations.
- **SO WHAT**: This initiative could spark innovations in how public institutions engage with communities in the digital realm, creating models for civic technology that prioritize autonomy and local control.

## Key questions for workshop
1. How might the fragmentation of digital infrastructure along geopolitical lines affect global internet governance and standards development?
2. What are the security implications of cities and regions developing their own isolated digital ecosystems and how might these affect international cooperation during crises?
3. How could the emergence of parallel technology stacks (American, European, Chinese) reshape global innovation patterns and technology transfer?
