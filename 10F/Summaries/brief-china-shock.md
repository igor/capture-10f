# Domain impact brief: New China trade shock impacts global manufacturing

## Summary
A "China Shock 2.0" is unfolding as Chinese exports diverted from the U.S. due to tariffs flood developing countries, devastating local industries. Indonesia's textile sector has already lost a quarter-million jobs in two years with a projected half-million more at risk, while countries from Mexico to Thailand are struggling to manage the influx of competitive Chinese goods. This situation is being exacerbated by Trump's renewed tariffs and threatens to reshape global economic relationships.

## Domains impacted

### Trade systems
- **WHAT**: Chinese manufacturers priced out of the U.S. market by tariffs are flooding alternative markets, while China's trade surplus reached a record high of nearly $1 trillion in 2024.
- **WHY**: China's need to export has intensified after President Xi deflated a property bubble around 2020 and ramped up manufacturing investment to sustain economic growth.
- **SO WHAT**: Developing economies are caught in a squeeze between American tariffs and Chinese exports, with potentially severe economic and political consequences as job losses mount.

### Migration
- **WHAT**: Widespread manufacturing job losses in developing countries are disrupting communities and potentially triggering population movements.
- **WHY**: The pace of job elimination is rapidâ€”Indonesia is losing garment jobs faster than the original "China Shock" displaced American workers between 1999-2011.
- **SO WHAT**: Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has linked growing violence in regions like Guanajuato state to large-scale job losses in manufacturing, suggesting security implications beyond pure economics.

### Global governance
- **WHAT**: Countries are implementing varied measures to protect domestic industries, including tariffs, taxes on online purchases, and investigations into dumping.
- **WHY**: Governments face a complex dilemma: they need to protect local industries and jobs while maintaining relations with China, often their largest trading partner and infrastructure financier.
- **SO WHAT**: China is effectively containing geopolitical fallout by ramping up diplomacy, portraying itself as a stable alternative to Trump, and keeping tariffs low for poorer countries as Trump raises them.

## Key questions for workshop
1. How might the combination of Trump's "America First" trade policies and China's export-driven growth model reshape global supply chains and trigger new forms of economic cooperation or competition?
2. What political movements or regimes might emerge in developing countries caught between Chinese economic pressure and U.S. tariff policies?
3. Could this situation accelerate the formation of new regional economic blocs as countries seek collective protection from both Chinese exports and U.S. tariffs?
