# Domain impact brief: End of current globalization era according to HSBC

## Summary
HSBC Chair Mark Tucker has declared that "globalization as we knew it" may have run its course, signaling a profound shift in global economic patterns. Tucker suggests the world is experiencing a period of deep change in trade and international relations, with growing regional blocs replacing previously efficient global supply chains. This restructuring represents a fundamental realignment of global economic power and trade relationships.

## Domains impacted

### Trade systems
- **WHAT**: The era of globally optimized supply chains prioritizing maximum economic efficiency appears to be ending.
- **WHY**: New trade tensions and tariffs (particularly from the Trump administration) have created uncertainty that poses "serious potential risk to global growth."
- **SO WHAT**: Rather than complete de-globalization, we'll likely see stronger economic ties between different political groupings and trade blocs, including the expanded "BRICS-plus" countries.

### Financial systems
- **WHAT**: HSBC, a dominant player in global trade finance, has recently restructured its operations along geographical lines (Asia/Middle East and Europe/Americas).
- **WHY**: The bank anticipates that economic connectivity between Asia and the Middle East is likely to "soar" in coming years.
- **SO WHAT**: New financial institutions and arrangements among emerging economies could create notable growth spillovers and reshape global finance outside Western-dominated systems.

### Global governance
- **WHAT**: The BRICS group (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) has expanded to include Iran, UAE, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Indonesia.
- **WHY**: Amid geopolitical tension, more emerging markets may join such alliances to foster closer ties and establish a stronger collective voice globally.
- **SO WHAT**: The BRICS expansion is building institutions with implications for energy, trade, finance, supply chains and technology, potentially offering alternatives to Western-led international governance.

## Key questions for workshop
1. How might Western financial institutions adapt to a world where economic power is increasingly distributed among regional blocs rather than concentrated in a U.S.-led system?
2. What new opportunities and risks emerge for multinational corporations as supply chains reorganize around political alliances rather than pure economic efficiency?
3. How could the rise of parallel financial and trade systems affect global stability, particularly during times of crisis when coordination is crucial?
