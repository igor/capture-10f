# Domain impact brief: Potential EU-China green alliance vs US-Russia petrostate axis

## Summary
Political scientist Nils Gilman speculates that we may be witnessing the emergence of a new geopolitical order with a Beijing-Brussels "Green Entente" emerging in opposition to a Washington-Moscow "Petrostate Axis." This realignment, driven by energy security concerns and climate priorities, could fundamentally reshape global politics in the coming decades. While not yet fully formed, recent developments make this scenario increasingly plausible rather than merely speculative.

## Domains impacted

### Energy systems
- **WHAT**: The U.S. and Russia, as the world's two largest oil producers, have shared material interests in maintaining hydrocarbon dominance, while China and the EU are the largest oil importers with growing investments in renewables.
- **WHY**: For both the U.S. and Russia, the proposed global green energy transition represents a potential "cashectomy of world-historical proportions," while Europe seeks energy autonomy after experiencing the consequences of dependence on Russian gas.
- **SO WHAT**: This material reality creates the foundation for a geopolitical realignment where China's renewable technology dominance could combine with Europe's regulatory framework to challenge the petrodollar system.

### Trade systems
- **WHAT**: A gradual EU-China economic realignment could emerge through bilateral agreements on clean energy, supply chain coordination, and technology sharing.
- **WHY**: China needs to transition from an export-driven model to a technology-driven green growth paradigm, while Europe aims to reduce dependence on American LNG and OPEC oil.
- **SO WHAT**: The potential creation of a "Green Bretton Woods" system could challenge the existing petrodollar system, fundamentally altering global trade architecture.

### Security
- **WHAT**: Long-term economic alignment between the EU and China could eventually lead to security cooperation on military technology, cybersecurity, and AI-driven energy defense systems.
- **WHY**: European security dependencies may be reevaluated if forced to choose between technology stacks controlled by competing power centers, with some European officials reportedly indicating preference for Chinese over Trumpist control.
- **SO WHAT**: Competition for resources in Africa and South America would intensify as the China-EU Entente and US-Russia axis struggle for control over global supply chains.

## Key questions for workshop
1. How might this realignment affect critical minerals and rare earth supply chains necessary for both renewable energy and defense technologies?
2. What role might India play as the potential decisive power between these emerging blocs?
3. How could rising climate impacts accelerate or reshape this potential geopolitical realignment in the next decade?
