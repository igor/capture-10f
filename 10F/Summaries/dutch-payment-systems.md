# Domain impact brief: European financial sovereignty

## Summary
The Dutch Central Bank (DNB) has expressed serious concerns about European reliance on US-based companies Visa and Mastercard for payment systems, warning they could be weaponized as pressure points against Europe. This represents part of a broader European push for financial sovereignty, with DNB supporting alternatives like the digital euro and expansion of the Dutch iDeal payment system across Europe. The warning comes amid rising US-EU tensions and increasing awareness of financial infrastructure as a strategic vulnerability.

## Domains most impacted

### Financial systems
- **WHAT**: European central bankers are actively working to reduce dependence on US-controlled payment infrastructure by developing sovereign alternatives like a digital euro and pan-European payment systems
- **WHY**: There is growing concern that President Trump could leverage US companies like Visa and Mastercard to exert political pressure on Europe, making payment infrastructure a national security issue
- **SO WHAT**: The push for payment sovereignty signals a fundamental restructuring of global financial architecture, with fragmentation along geopolitical lines becoming increasingly likely

### Tech governance
- **WHAT**: European officials are prioritizing development of digital payment technologies that operate independently of non-European platforms, including crisis-resilient systems that function even during internet outages
- **WHY**: Technological independence is increasingly viewed as essential for maintaining economic sovereignty and security in an era of weaponized interdependence
- **SO WHAT**: This acceleration of sovereign digital infrastructure development will reshape tech governance frameworks and potentially create competing regional standards

### Security
- **WHAT**: The Dutch Central Bank is considering redirecting some of its investments into defense and cybersecurity companies, signaling a significant shift in central bank investment strategy
- **WHY**: Financial institutions are recognizing that geopolitical realignment requires stronger domestic security capabilities and infrastructure resilience
- **SO WHAT**: The mainstreaming of security concerns into core financial policy represents a fundamental shift from post-Cold War economic integration toward strategic autonomy

## Key questions for workshop
1. How might the fragmentation of global payment systems into competing geopolitical blocs affect international trade patterns and economic integration?
2. What new vulnerabilities might emerge in the transition period as Europe develops alternative financial infrastructure while still dependent on existing systems?
3. How will smaller nations and developing economies navigate an increasingly bifurcated global financial system divided between US and alternative payment infrastructures?
