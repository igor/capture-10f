# Domain impact brief: China's renewable energy leadership reshapes Eurasian geopolitics

## Summary
China's massive renewable energy infrastructure buildout is fundamentally transforming the geopolitical, economic, and cultural landscape of Eurasia. With two-thirds of global wind and solar projects under construction and plans to install more than half of the world's solar power in 2024, China is creating a new industrial order that extends from Mongolia to Saudi Arabia. This transition is not merely technical but represents a comprehensive reordering of alliances, trade routes, and resource dependencies across the post-Soviet space and Arab world. As China deliberately pivots away from fossil fuels, traditionally oil-dependent nations like Saudi Arabia are being forced to reimagine their future, while resource-rich but population-poor nations like Russia find themselves increasingly subordinate to Chinese economic interests.

## Domains impacted

### Energy Systems
- **WHAT**: China is constructing a continental-scale renewable energy network spanning Eurasia, building new towns, capitals, and infrastructure connected by transmission lines to vast solar and wind installations.
- **WHY**: Climate change pressures combined with China's strategic drive for energy autonomy are accelerating this transition, with renewable power increasingly becoming more economical than fossil fuels even in traditional petrostate contexts.
- **SO WHAT**: This represents a fundamental rebalancing of global energy geopolitics away from the petrodollar system that has dominated since the mid-20th century, creating new dependencies and vulnerabilities while potentially accelerating the global energy transition beyond what Western models predicted.

### Supply Chains
- **WHAT**: The scramble for critical minerals is reshaping economic relationships, with previously marginal states like Mongolia gaining new strategic importance due to their copper, lithium, and graphite deposits essential for renewable technologies.
- **WHY**: China's dominant position in clean energy manufacturing creates competitive pressure to secure critical mineral supply chains, while its occasional export bans on rare earth elements create openings for smaller suppliers.
- **SO WHAT**: A new resource colonialism is emerging across Eurasia, with China at the center, creating a cascade of dependencies where resources flow to China while manufacturing expertise and infrastructure flow outward, fundamentally altering global supply chain architectures.

### Security Alliances & Military Technologies
- **WHAT**: Resource-rich nations are strategically reorienting toward China while hedging with "third neighbor" policies to maintain some autonomy, as evidenced by Mongolia's balancing act between China, Russia, and Western powers.
- **WHY**: The economic magnetism of China's renewable energy industrial complex is reshaping traditional security alignments, pulling resource-rich nations into China's orbit regardless of historical relationships or cultural affinities.
- **SO WHAT**: A new security architecture is emerging in Eurasia that undermines Western influence, with Russia potentially becoming a resource appendage to China rather than an equal partner, despite Russian intellectual fantasies of a Eurasian revival under their leadership.

## Key questions for workshop

1. How might traditional petrostates beyond Saudi Arabia adapt to China's renewable energy pivot, and what implications might their success or failure have for global stability?

2. What forms of resistance or alternative governance models might emerge in response to China's techno-industrial expansion across Eurasia?

3. How might the contradictions between China's hyper-modern, rationalist approach and Russia's romantic Eurasianist ideology resolve themselves in the emerging regional order?
