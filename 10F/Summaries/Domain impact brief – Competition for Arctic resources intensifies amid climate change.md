# Domain impact brief: Competition for Arctic resources intensifies amid climate change

## Summary
Climate change is transforming the Arctic from an inhospitable barrier into a contested frontier, triggering a multi-sided competition for resources and shipping routes. Canada is racing to assert sovereignty over its vast northern territories and waters, including the Northwest Passage, which is becoming increasingly accessible as polar ice melts. This strategic shift has prompted Canada to invest $73 billion in Arctic defense over 20 years while facing pressure from multiple directions: Russia's established Arctic presence, China's self-designation as a "near-Arctic nation," and the United States' ambiguous stance under President Trump, who has threatened to "annex Canada via economic force" and explicitly challenged Canadian sovereignty over the Northwest Passage.

## Domains impacted

### Security Alliances & Military Technologies
- **WHAT**: Canada is fundamentally restructuring its Arctic defense strategy, with $6 billion for a new radar system to modernize NORAD, increased military presence at Arctic bases, and acquisition of submarines, icebreakers, and F-35 fighter jets.
- **WHY**: Climate change has eliminated the Arctic's natural defense barrier, creating new vulnerabilities while Russia maintains significant military infrastructure in its Arctic region and the U.S. under Trump has adopted an increasingly assertive stance.
- **SO WHAT**: The militarization of the Arctic represents a fundamental shift in North American security arrangements, potentially straining the traditionally close U.S.-Canada alliance while creating new scenarios for great power competition in a previously inaccessible region.

### Global Commons Governance
- **WHAT**: Competing claims over Arctic shipping lanes and resources are intensifying, with Canada insisting the Northwest Passage remains "sovereign waters" while the U.S. challenges this designation.
- **WHY**: Scientists predict the first "ice-free day" in the Arctic Ocean could occur before 2030, transforming previously inaccessible shipping routes and resource extraction zones into valuable strategic assets.
- **SO WHAT**: The established governance framework for Arctic management is increasingly inadequate as climate change creates new economic opportunities, with the potential for unilateral actions by major powers to establish precedents that undermine cooperative management of this shared region.

### Trade Systems
- **WHAT**: The Arctic is being reconceptualized as a critical resource repository, particularly for rare earth elements and critical minerals essential to digital economies and low-carbon transitions, with the U.S. explicitly identifying Canadian Arctic minerals as motivation for "hemispheric defense."
- **WHY**: The region holds an estimated 13% of the world's undiscovered oil, 30% of undiscovered natural gas, and significant deposits of critical minerals, creating powerful economic incentives for resource extraction as accessibility improves.
- **SO WHAT**: Competition for Arctic resources could accelerate the fragmentation of global trade into security-aligned blocs, with critical mineral supply chains becoming increasingly politicized and subject to military protection or denial strategies.

## Key questions for workshop

1. How might traditional alliances like NATO evolve if Arctic territorial disputes between members (particularly the U.S. and Canada) intensify under a second Trump administration?

2. What new governance institutions or frameworks might emerge to manage Arctic resources and shipping routes as traditional barriers to access disappear?

3. How might indigenous knowledge and governance systems, exemplified by Canada's Rangers program, be integrated into or marginalized by emerging Arctic security frameworks?
