# Domain impact brief: Defense sector real estate boom

## Summary
Defense and aerospace companies are driving a significant surge in specialized real estate leasing, with occupied space increasing from 7.1 million square feet in 2022 to 11.3 million in 2024. This trend is fueled by record defense spending, global conflicts, and increased investment in aerospace and defense startups, creating demand for highly secured, specialized manufacturing and research facilities. The boom reflects a broader militarization of commercial real estate and economic activity amid escalating global tensions.

## Domains most impacted

### Military technologies
- **WHAT**: Defense tech startups are rapidly expanding their physical footprint to develop and test advanced weaponry, drones, and autonomous systems prioritized by the Defense Department
- **WHY**: Despite proposed 8% defense budget cuts, Secretary Hegseth is redirecting spending toward drones and autonomous weapon systems that startups can develop more quickly than traditional contractors
- **SO WHAT**: This physical infrastructure expansion will accelerate the development and deployment cycle of next-generation military technologies, potentially shifting warfare capabilities and defense industry power dynamics

### Security
- **WHAT**: Companies are investing heavily in specialized secure facilities (SCIFs) that can cost $1 million+ to build, with features like drone nets and protection against surveillance
- **WHY**: Defense contractors must ensure spaces are free from foreign ownership, spying risks, and technological vulnerabilities to protect classified communications with military clients
- **SO WHAT**: The proliferation of these secured spaces into commercial real estate creates a parallel infrastructure of classified work environments, blurring lines between military and civilian sectors

### Urban development
- **WHAT**: Cities and regions are competing to attract defense and aerospace companies through incentives like flexible permitting, rezoning, and development assistance
- **WHY**: These industries offer high-tech, high-paying jobs that provide greater economic benefits than traditional warehouse or logistics operations
- **SO WHAT**: This trend is reshaping urban industrial zones and creating specialized defense-aerospace clusters that will influence regional economic development patterns for decades

## Key questions for workshop
1. How might the concentration of defense innovation in specific geographic clusters affect global security dynamics and technology transfer patterns?
2. What are the potential consequences of blending civilian and military infrastructure as defense startups increasingly occupy commercial spaces?
3. How will the shift toward advanced manufacturing techniques like 3D printing within these facilities change supply chain vulnerabilities and resilience?
