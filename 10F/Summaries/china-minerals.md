# Domain impact brief: China's strategic minerals strategy

## Summary
China is significantly increasing state funding for domestic minerals exploration and development, with at least half of its 34 provincial governments announcing expanded subsidies or access for mineral exploration in the past year. This strategic push, aligned with President Xi Jinping's resource self-sufficiency ambitions, comes amid intensifying competition with the US over control of critical resources needed for advanced technologies. The initiative represents a deliberate fortification of supply chains as minerals emerge as a key flashpoint in the US-China technological competition.

## Domains most impacted

### Trade systems
- **WHAT**: China has tightened control over exports of strategic minerals crucial to chip manufacturing, including gallium, germanium, antimony, graphite, and tungsten, while simultaneously boosting domestic exploration
- **WHY**: These actions directly respond to US technology export restrictions and President Trump's prioritization of domestic mining since his return to office in January 2025
- **SO WHAT**: Control over critical mineral supply chains has emerged as a central leverage point in the escalating US-China trade and technology competition, reshaping global trade patterns

### Tech governance
- **WHAT**: China is investing extensively in securing resources critical for semiconductors, electric vehicles, robotics, and advanced military systems while restricting foreign access to mining areas
- **WHY**: Xi's focus on technological self-reliance since 2012 has intensified amid escalating tensions, with strategic minerals becoming crucial to maintaining manufacturing advantages
- **SO WHAT**: This resource competition will significantly influence which nations can maintain technological sovereignty and manufacturing leadership in emerging high-tech sectors

### Energy systems
- **WHAT**: China's dominance in 30 of 44 critical minerals tracked by the US Geological Survey gives it significant control over resources needed for energy transition technologies
- **WHY**: Beyond immediate tech competition, securing these resources supports China's long-term positioning in clean energy manufacturing and advanced energy storage systems
- **SO WHAT**: Control of these resources will determine which nations lead in next-generation energy technologies, affecting both climate transition capabilities and future energy geopolitics

## Key questions for workshop
1. How might competing mineral security strategies reshape global supply chains and create new geopolitical alliances among resource-rich nations?
2. What alternative governance mechanisms might emerge to manage critical mineral access if current resource nationalism continues to intensify?
3. How will developing nations with significant mineral resources navigate competing pressures from both China and the US in this new resource competition era?
