# Domain impact brief: Global fragmentation across key systems

## Summary
Global systems are rapidly fragmenting along geopolitical lines as security concerns supersede economic efficiency. Previously integrated global frameworks are splintering into competing regional ecosystems, with three distinct regulatory regimes emerging across most domains. Access to resources, technologies, and markets is increasingly determined by alliance membership rather than economic principles, creating unprecedented disruptions to established patterns of trade, finance, and information exchange.

## Domains impacted

### Trade Systems
- **WHAT**: The WTO-centered global trading system is being dismantled as security-aligned trading blocs carve up global markets, with access increasingly determined by geopolitical loyalty rather than economic reciprocity.
- **WHY**: National security imperatives now override efficiency considerations, forcing companies to choose between developing multiple market-specific products or abandoning entire regions.
- **SO WHAT**: Decades of established trade patterns are being upended virtually overnight, creating new power centers in "gateway nations" that strategically position themselves between rival blocs, while fundamentally altering global supply chain architecture.

### Digital Information Ecosystem
- **WHAT**: Global information spaces are fracturing along geopolitical lines, with content, algorithms, and data access increasingly governed by regional frameworks rather than universal standards.
- **WHY**: The dissolution of shared technological governance has created three distinct regulatory regimes where one global standard once existed, with cross-border data flows facing unprecedented restrictions.
- **SO WHAT**: Divergent information realities are emerging where exposure to news, research, and innovations depends more on alliance membership than open internet principles, potentially creating isolated information bubbles that reinforce bloc-based worldviews.

### Financial Architecture
- **WHAT**: The dollar-dominated system faces its first serious challenge in decades as competing currency zones and payment systems splinter global finance.
- **WHY**: Strategic competition has moved beyond traditional economic spheres into financial infrastructure, creating parallel systems designed to reduce vulnerability to sanctions and financial pressure.
- **SO WHAT**: Companies must now navigate complex hedging strategies while financial intermediaries scramble to maintain cross-bloc transactions, potentially creating new vulnerabilities where interdependence once existed and reshaping the global investment landscape.

## Key questions for workshop

1. How might the emergence of "gateway nations" straddling rival blocs create new opportunities for diplomatic or economic leverage in a fragmented global order?

2. What mechanisms or institutions could emerge to facilitate necessary coordination between competing blocs on truly global challenges like climate change or pandemic response?

3. How might fragmentation of digital information ecosystems impact scientific research, technological innovation, and global knowledge production in the coming decade?
