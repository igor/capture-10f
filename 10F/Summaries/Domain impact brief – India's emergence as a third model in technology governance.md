## Summary
After a decade of successful digital transformation, India is positioning itself as a distinct alternative to both the American market-driven model and Chinese state-controlled approach to technology governance. The country's Digital India initiative has yielded significant achievements, including widespread adoption of digital identities, payment systems, and expanded internet access. India is now exporting its digital public infrastructure model to emerging economies across the Global South. However, this digital advancement exists alongside concerning practices such as frequent internet shutdowns, content moderation controversies, and restrictions on digital rights. As global powers realign, India's technological assertiveness represents a significant development in the fragmentation of global technology governance regimes.

## Domains impacted

### Technology Governance
- **WHAT**: India is actively developing and promoting an alternative model to U.S. and Chinese technology governance frameworks, one that blends state-directed development with market dynamics while maintaining strong government control over digital spaces.
- **WHY**: The growing influence of India's Digital India initiative, including digital identity system Aadhaar and the Unified Payments Interface, is giving the country confidence to project its approach globally, particularly to developing nations seeking alternatives to Western or Chinese models.
- **SO WHAT**: A three-way fragmentation of global technology governance is emerging, with India's approach—combining digital public infrastructure with strong sovereign controls—gaining traction across the Global South and potentially reducing the influence of both Western rights-based regulations and Chinese state-centric models.

### Financial Architecture
- **WHAT**: India's Unified Payments Interface and related digital financial infrastructure have created one of the world's most advanced digital payment ecosystems, with models being exported to other emerging economies.
- **WHY**: Government-led initiatives to formalize the economy and expand financial inclusion have accelerated digital adoption, while India's technological talent base has enabled sophisticated implementation at unprecedented scale.
- **SO WHAT**: India's financial technology approach could challenge Western payment systems and Chinese mobile payment dominance in emerging markets, creating a third global financial technology stack that combines elements of state oversight with market innovation, potentially fragmenting global financial interoperability.

### Social Values & Identity Systems
- **WHAT**: India's approach to digital governance reflects complex tensions between technological advancement and rights-based concerns, with the country simultaneously leading in digital inclusion while conducting the highest number of internet shutdowns globally (over 800 in the past decade).
- **WHY**: The ruling BJP government views digital sovereignty as central to national security and cultural integrity, leading to restrictions that concern human rights advocates but resonate with nationalist sentiments across many developing nations.
- **SO WHAT**: India's model demonstrates that technological advancement need not follow Western liberal democratic norms, offering an alternative vision of digital society that may appeal to nations uncomfortable with both American tech dominance and Chinese-style digital authoritarianism, further fragmenting global consensus on digital rights frameworks.

## Key questions for workshop

1. How might India's position as a technology governance model shift if economic or geopolitical pressures (such as Trump's proposed 100% tariffs on BRICS nations) force it to align more closely with either American or Chinese approaches?

2. What implications does India's digital public infrastructure model have for the development of artificial intelligence governance, particularly in nations seeking alternatives to U.S. or Chinese AI frameworks?

3. Could India's internal contradictions—digital advancement alongside democratic backsliding—undermine its credibility as a model for other developing nations, or will pragmatic technological progress outweigh rights concerns?
