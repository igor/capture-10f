# Domain Impact Brief: The Battle for Digital Currency Dominance

## Summary
European officials are urgently pursuing a digital euro as a strategic response to the Trump administration's push to solidify U.S. dominance of international payments through dollar-denominated stablecoins. This geoeconomic front represents the next major battlefield beyond tariffs, with European authorities concerned about both financial autonomy and technological control over the economy, positioning the digital euro as a crucial defense against potential "digital dollarization."

## Domains Most Significantly Impacted

### 1. Financial Systems
- **WHAT**: The Eurozone is already heavily dependent on American payment mechanisms, with two-thirds of card payments processed by non-European providers and 13 of 20 euro-using countries lacking national card-payment systems.
- **WHY**: The weaponization of the dollar-based financial system (cutting off adversaries from Swift) has prompted quests for alternatives, while stablecoins offer an instant, cheap alternative to traditional banking.
- **SO WHAT**: Without a digital euro, Europe faces the risk of "digital dollarization" where sales platforms encourage pricing, transactions, and balances in U.S. stablecoins, undermining central bank monetary control.

### 2. Tech Governance
- **WHAT**: European officials view the digital euro project as both defensive necessity and opportunity to create a new tech economy through payment "rails" guaranteed by the central bank.
- **WHY**: The Trump administration's executive order promoting worldwide use of privately issued U.S. dollar stablecoins is backed by administration figures with deep ties to the payments technology business.
- **SO WHAT**: The initiative represents Europe's attempt to make up for its lag in tech innovation while creating a payment infrastructure that could link to non-euro currencies and compete internationally.

### 3. Global Governance
- **WHAT**: The digital euro initiative aims to circumvent U.S. control of international payments by creating an alternative system free from American oversight.
- **WHY**: Previous experience showed Europe could not act autonomously when U.S. sanctions were placed on Iran due to dependency on U.S.-exposed banks.
- **SO WHAT**: This represents a strategic attempt to rebalance power in the global financial system, potentially reducing U.S. geoeconomic leverage while creating an alternative power center.

## Key Questions for Workshop
1. How might competing digital currency systems interact with existing financial institutions, potentially creating new systemic risks or opportunities for regulatory arbitrage?
2. What second-order effects might emerge from the creation of parallel payment infrastructures on international trade, sanctions enforcement, and monetary sovereignty?
3. How could the competition between digital currencies reshape power dynamics between state and non-state actors in the global financial system?
