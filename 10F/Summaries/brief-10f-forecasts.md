# Domain impact brief: Global forecasting initiative for post-Trump geopolitical realignment

## Summary
The 10F consortium proposes bringing together twenty world-class strategic forecasters to produce ten critical open-source forecasts addressing the dramatic geopolitical realignment catalyzed by recent U.S. policy shifts. This initiative aims to equip leaders navigating a collapsing multilateral system with critical foresight tools for the decade ahead, making these strategic insights freely accessible through a Creative Commons license.

## Domains impacted

### Global governance
- **WHAT**: The post-Cold War multilateral system is undergoing radical transformation, with foundational structures rapidly shifting.
- **WHY**: The Trump Administration's reorientation of U.S. power has pushed interconnected global systems to a critical inflection point, accelerating changes already set in motion by multiple factors.
- **SO WHAT**: The resulting vacuums create tremendous risks and opportunities for realignment, requiring leaders to understand near, mid, and long-term implications.

### Civil society
- **WHAT**: Open-source forecasts will be made publicly available to equip leaders across governments, businesses, institutions, and civil society.
- **WHY**: Currently, insights regarding longer-term geopolitical implications are often confined to proprietary sources, limiting access to critical intelligence.
- **SO WHAT**: By providing open access forecasts, the initiative intends to distribute strategic advantages more equitably across sectors and organizations.

### Information ecosystems
- **WHAT**: The project will deliver forecasts through multiple formats, including downloadable PDFs, interactive online repositories, and responsive query interfaces.
- **WHY**: Leaders need accessible, adaptable tools that can be incorporated into existing knowledge systems.
- **SO WHAT**: Open-sourcing these forecasts creates potential for widespread adoption and integration across different information infrastructures globally.

## Key questions for workshop
1. How might the convergence of multiple crises (pandemic, climate change, technological disruption, populism) create unique second-order effects that were previously considered improbable?
2. In what ways could the collapse of the multilateral system create opportunities for new forms of global cooperation outside traditional structures?
3. How might different regional powers respond to U.S. policy shifts, and what new alignments or coalitions could form as a result?
