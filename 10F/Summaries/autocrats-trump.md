# Domain impact brief: Autocratic rollback of rights

## Summary
Autocratic governments around the world are increasingly citing Trump's statements, policies, and actions as justification for restricting LGBTQ+ rights, freedom of expression, and undermining rule of law. Hungary's implementation of antigay "propaganda" laws has resulted in bookstores being fined for selling LGBTQ+ themed books without sealed plastic wrappers and a museum director's firing, illustrating how democratic backsliding is accelerating with American policy shifts providing diplomatic cover. This pattern signals an emerging global trend of rights erosion legitimized by US precedent.

## Domains most impacted

### Civil society
- **WHAT**: Autocratic governments are implementing and expanding restrictions on fundamental freedoms while citing American policy shifts as precedent or cover
- **WHY**: The current US administration's positions and rhetoric provide legitimization opportunities for authoritarian leaders to accelerate democratic backsliding
- **SO WHAT**: Civil society organizations face shrinking operational space globally as autocrats perceive reduced diplomatic consequences for rights violations

### Social values
- **WHAT**: LGBTQ+ communities are experiencing targeted restrictions through "propaganda" laws that limit expression, representation, and access to information
- **WHY**: Conservative social policies create popular wedge issues that autocratic leaders can exploit to demonstrate sovereignty and challenge liberal international norms
- **SO WHAT**: The rollback of rights protections signals a broader international realignment away from post-Cold War human rights frameworks toward more nationalistic value systems

### Global governance
- **WHAT**: Traditional human rights advocacy and enforcement mechanisms are weakening as their strongest historical proponent shifts stance
- **WHY**: US leadership previously provided diplomatic weight behind international human rights standards, but now offers examples that undermine those same norms
- **SO WHAT**: The international rights-based order faces a legitimacy crisis as enforcement mechanisms lose effectiveness and autocratic governance models gain credibility

## Key questions for workshop
1. How might the interaction between declining US rights leadership and rising autocratic coordination reshape global human rights frameworks over the next decade?
2. What alternative civil society protection mechanisms might emerge if traditional diplomatic pressure for rights protection continues to weaken?
3. How will multinational corporations navigate increasingly divergent values-based regulatory environments as rights protections splinter across regions?
