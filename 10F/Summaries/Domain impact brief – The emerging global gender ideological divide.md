# Domain impact brief: The emerging global gender ideological divide

## Summary
A significant ideological gap is rapidly emerging between young men and young women across the globe. While previous generations typically shared political views regardless of gender, Gen Z is experiencing a pronounced divergence, with young women adopting more progressive positions and young men either remaining static or shifting toward conservative views. This divide, which began with the #MeToo movement, has expanded beyond issues of sexual harassment to encompass views on immigration, racial justice, and other political matters. The trend spans countries across multiple continents, with particularly extreme manifestations in South Korea, where it has contributed to plummeting marriage and birth rates.

## Domains impacted

### Social Values & Identity Systems
- **WHAT**: An unprecedented ideological chasm has developed between young men and young women in countries worldwide, with gaps of 25-30 percentage points on liberal-conservative scales emerging in just six years.
- **WHY**: The #MeToo movement served as a catalyst, empowering young women to embrace feminist values while many young men have reacted by either maintaining traditional views or actively shifting rightward.
- **SO WHAT**: This represents a fundamental restructuring of social identity formation, where gender is becoming a stronger predictor of ideological alignment than shared generational experiences, potentially creating enduring polarization that could persist as these cohorts age.

### Civil Society & Democratic Institutions
- **WHAT**: Young men and women are increasingly diverging in their political affiliations, with young women supporting progressive parties and young men backing conservative or far-right options at much higher rates than previous generations.
- **WHY**: The gendered experiences of digital culture and social media have created separate information ecosystems that reinforce divergent worldviews, despite young people occupying the same physical spaces.
- **SO WHAT**: As these cohorts age into greater political participation, democratic institutions may face new challenges in building broad-based coalitions, with gender becoming a more significant political fault line than traditional cleavages like class, potentially reshaping party systems and governance approaches.

### Population Movements & Demographics
- **WHAT**: In countries with extreme gender divides like South Korea, marriage rates have plummeted and birth rates have fallen to record lows (0.78 births per woman in 2022, the world's lowest).
- **WHY**: Fundamental disagreements about gender roles, power dynamics, and social values are making partnership formation more difficult between increasingly ideologically incompatible young men and women.
- **SO WHAT**: This ideological divergence could accelerate demographic challenges in developed nations, creating economic and social pressures related to aging populations, pension systems, and healthcare that could necessitate entirely new approaches to population policy and social welfare.

## Key questions for workshop

1. How might digital platform governance approaches evolve to address the role of social media in accelerating gender-based ideological sorting?

2. What economic implications might emerge in societies where young men and women increasingly operate according to fundamentally different value systems?

3. If this divergence persists as Gen Z ages, how might it reshape political party structures and electoral strategies over the next two decades?
