# Domain impact brief: Foreign Trade Zones as tariff workarounds

## Summary
U.S. Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) are experiencing renewed interest as companies seek workarounds to Trump's impending "Liberation Day" tariffs. These special economic areas, which allow companies to store imported goods without paying customs fees or manufacture products at potentially lower import charges, were originally created during the Smoot-Hawley tariff era and exemplify a pattern of "national globalism" where protectionist policies create new forms of globalization within national borders.

## Domains impacted

### Trade Systems
- **WHAT**: Companies are increasingly turning to U.S. Foreign Trade Zones to stockpile goods and potentially bypass Trump's impending tariffs, with FTZ industry conferences seeing record attendance.
- **WHY**: Trump's rapid implementation of trade restrictions through executive orders is driving businesses to seek flexibility and control by utilizing these tariff-exempt areas within U.S. borders.
- **SO WHAT**: This adaptation represents a significant shift in supply chain strategy where companies maintain global sourcing while adapting to nationalist trade policies, potentially creating a parallel trade system operating under different rules.

### Supply Chains
- **WHAT**: Businesses are investigating FTZs to stockpile specific goods including car parts, pharmaceutical products, and air conditioning units ahead of anticipated tariff implementation.
- **WHY**: These zones offer companies the ability to temporarily store imported products without paying customs fees or manufacture with imported components at potentially reduced rates.
- **SO WHAT**: This tactical response could reshape supply chain geography, leading to clustering of certain industries around FTZs and creating new bottlenecks or opportunities in the logistics landscape.

### Financial Systems
- **WHAT**: The resurgence of interest in FTZs represents a financial hedging strategy against policy volatility, with companies incurring storage costs to avoid potentially larger tariff expenses.
- **WHY**: The unpredictability of tariff implementation and potential carve-outs is forcing companies to make financial bets on policy outcomes through infrastructure investments.
- **SO WHAT**: This shift could create a secondary market of FTZ-related services and financial products designed to hedge against trade policy risks, potentially transforming how companies account for geopolitical risk in their financial planning.

## Key questions for workshop

1. How might the expansion of FTZ utilization reshape the power dynamics between national governments, multinational corporations, and trade enforcement agencies?

2. What unexpected consequences might emerge if significant portions of trade begin flowing through FTZ workarounds rather than traditional channels?

3. How might the tension between "national globalism" and protectionism create entirely new economic structures or governance models at the intersection of domestic and international commerce?
