The Trump administration is cutting funding, while specifically targeting institutions like Columbia. No wonder academics want out

I n six weeks, the Trump administration’s “ [rapid scheduled disassembly](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/16/elon-musk-falcon-9-rapid-unscheduled-disassembly) ” of American science has been as sharp and deep as its trashing of the US’s alliances and goodwill; Earth science, [weather forecasting](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/climate/noaa-layoffs-trump.html) and early warning systems, [medical research](https://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/scientific-research-getting-cut-and-should-scare-all-americans) (including [cancer research](https://apnews.com/article/trump-science-medicine-research-cancer-funding-university-0ef3fa47694784e47b0ecd51680410ba) ), [Nasa](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/mar/10/nasa-cuts-firing-chief-scientist). Academic grants [more broadly](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/science-research-policy/2025/02/03/how-trumps-executive-orders-are-disrupting) have been cut, paused and subject to review for a long list of [banned words](https://gizmodo.com/the-list-of-trumps-forbidden-words-that-will-get-your-paper-flagged-at-nsf-2000559661) (including such contentious terms as “political” and “women”).

This has caused universities across the country to [reduce their intake](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/trump-universities-higher-education-cuts) of PhD students, medical students and other graduate students, introduce hiring freezes and even rescind some offers of admission. More than 12,500 US citizens currently in other countries on Fulbright research grants recently had their [funding paused,](https://apnews.com/article/fulbright-scholars-stipends-frozen-indefinitely-9da042b5e0bda70fb1c76105564c71f4) along with 7,400 foreign scholars currently hosted in the US, leaving them [financially stranded](https://woub.org/2025/03/07/fulbright-scholars-feel-stranded-trump-administration-suspends-funding/). And, when it came to one foreign academic visiting the US, detaining them and [refusing them entry](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/19/trump-musk-french-scientist-detained).

Even more worryingly, the administration is specifically targeting some universities, including pulling [$400m in funding](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/07/trump-administration-cancels-columbia-university-funding) from Columbia University, and $800m from Johns Hopkins, forcing it to [lay off](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/13/johns-hopkins-job-cuts-usaid) 2,000 people. Furthermore, the legally dubious arrest and detention of [Mahmoud Khalil](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/18/mahmoud-khalil-statement-columbia), and the cancelling of his green card, is sure to have a chilling effect on foreign students and researchers already in the US – and on the desire of others to go there in the future. As Christina Pagel, a German-British professor at University College London, writes: “ [This isn’t chaos](https://christinapagel.substack.com/p/censor-purge-defund-how-trump-following?triedRedirect=true).” Instead, the attacks on research appear to follow a three-pronged objective: to forcibly align science with state ideology; undermine academic independence and suppress dissent; and maintain geopolitical and economic goals.

The Saturn V rockets that took US astronauts to space – and eventually the moon – in the 1960s owed their existence to [Operation Paperclip](https://slate.com/technology/2023/08/nasa-nazi-history-von-braun.html), which brought 1,500 former Nazi scientists (such as Wernher von Braun, the former director of Nasa’s Marshall Space Flight Center) to the US. In the week after Donald Trump’s election, I wondered whether the German philosopher Jürgen Habermas may inadvertently get his wish (of a Europe that unified through opposition to the US) and suggested that Europe position itself to reverse the decades-long [transatlantic brain drain](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/13/americans-googling-move-to-europe-welcome-them-brain-drain) by welcoming highly educated American researchers and scientists who were sure to find themselves under attack. This time, there is no moral quandary about it, no Nazi pasts to ignore; only as much advantage to be gained as can be in a world where the EU must hold the ground for liberal democratic society, joined by Canada to the west, and Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand to the east.

To some extent, EU governments and institutions are already picking up on the opportunity. For example, on 7 March, the University of Aix-Marseille [announced Safe Place for Science](https://www.univ-amu.fr/fr/public/actualites/safe-place-science-aix-marseille-universite-prete-accueillir-les-scientifiques), a three-year, €15m programme to bring 15 American scientists working in climate, health and astrophysics to its campus. According to a university spokesperson, more than 60 applications have been received, 30 of them coming within the first 24 hours. The university indicated that it has been in contact with [other universities](https://civis.eu/en) and the French government about expanding “scientific asylum” on both a national and European level, and to help coordinate welcoming and relocating different researchers.

US federal government spending on all research and development (R&D) totalled roughly [$195bn](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R48307/1#:~:text=On%20March%2011%2C%202024%2C%20President,estimated%20level%20of%20%24194.6%20billion.) in 2024. That sounds imposing, but let’s put it into greater context. As of 2023, US GDP was [$27.7tn](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=US) and EU GDP was [$26.5tn](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.PP.CD?locations=EU), when adjusted for purchasing power parity. Taken as a whole, both polities are roughly the same economic size. Let’s imagine that the EU were to put real money on the table to lure science of all kinds out of the US and to the continent. It wouldn’t need to match $195bn, euro for dollar, in part because more than half the US total is [defence R&D](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf25301#:~:text=In%20FY%202022%2C%20total%20budget,RDT%26E%20obligations%20were%20%24115.9%20billion.&text=This%20InfoBrief%20will%20provide%20data,the%20larger%20defense%20RDT%26E%20portfolio.), and the EU is already boosting defence spending … *[bigly](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-37483869)*. So, say it just picked a bold, round number that lends itself well to narrative, storytelling and headlines, and is enough to rope in the cuts happening in the US.

A sum of €25bn a year would represent just under 0.1% of the EU’s GDP, and even less if the UK, Norway and Switzerland (all of which participate in the Horizon Europe research funding programme) were included. As it is, R&D spending in the EU lags behind the US – and a report ordered by the European Commission’s research department [recently recommended](https://www.politico.eu/article/double-eu-research-budget-or-loose-against-us-china-experts-warn-report-horizon-europe/) more than doubling Horizon Europe’s €95bn, seven-year budget. What I’m suggesting goes further, yes. But not only is it well within the EU’s ability to afford, it would ultimately pay for itself: research found that non-defence R&D spending [returned 200%](https://www.ft.com/content/9309c11e-d997-4557-b209-62dcf27cb51d) for the US during the postwar period.

But let me push the boundary of fantastical again, and suggest that the EU may lure not just American researchers, but American universities themselves. According to the [Cross Border Education Research Team](https://www.cbert.org/intl-campus), US universities maintain 29 actual campuses in Europe (and far more if you include “centres” and study abroad programmes). There are dozens of American colleges and universities with [enormous endowments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colleges_and_universities_in_the_United_States_by_endowment) that regularly splash out hundreds of millions of dollars at a time [on new buildings](https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/SCDC%20Digital%20Brochure.pdf). If US crackdowns (like the [recent demands](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/nyregion/columbia-university-students-disciplined-hamilton-hall.html) made of Columbia) on academic freedom, funding, and foreign students and faculties become more frequent, they may find the idea of second campuses in Europe tempting indeed.
